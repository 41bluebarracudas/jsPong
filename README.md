# jsPong

Just like the original! This is my first step into game development. Created with vanilla JS.

V1.0.0

User is left player. You control the paddle with the mouse. 
Computer is right player. Still pretty unintelligent, it just chases the ball. 
The game is currently set to 3 points wins. If you want a higher score, change the so creatively named: const WINNING_SCORE


# Wishful Thinking 


It would be great to have a cleaner UI. Keep it retro, but you know, just nicer retro. 

Difficulty levels for the compy. Hard could be a compy paddle that anticipates bounces.

Powerups that randomly generate on the walls or on the court. Things like speed boost or crazy bounce.

Two player integration online.

Different controls. Keyboard controls so two people could play on the same machine.

Dynamic sizing of the canvas for fullscreen.
